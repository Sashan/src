.Xr btrace 8
to find symbols of traced process when collecting stack traces.
.Pp
.Fa shlibinfo
points to structure which holds pointer to array of
.Vt shlibinfo_entry
structures and number of elements in the array.
.Nm
is currently intended for use by
.Xr ld.so 1 .
The run-time linker constructs the process from shared objects.
Each shared object is loaded to virtual address in process from
file system. The
.Vt shlibinfo_entry
structure holds that information for each shared object.
.Vt sie_start
and
.Vt sie_end
members define address range in process virtual memory occupied
by shared object.
.Vt sie_path
is NUL terminated string which holds file system path to shared object (.so).

.Sh ERRORS
.It Bq Er EPERM
When dynamic tracing is not allowed (kern.allowdt is 0).

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
syscall is specific to the
.Ox
dynamic linker and should not be used in portable applications.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
syscall appeared in
.Ox 7.8 .
